## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- *I'm currently working on...* a planetary terrain generator! I'm exploring using volumetric noise/pixels, fibonacci spheres, and perlin noise.
- *Iâ€™m currently learning...* about Game Development at JCCC. Sidenote: I just got my first mac which I use for game development. Despite the stigma, so far it's been great as a development tool and I think more of us game devs ought to give macos a shot. Feel free to reach out if you're considering mac and want some rando's opinion ( or to argue, that's fine too ).
- *Contact:* You can reach me at contactme-github@sami.mozmail.com (I might reply from another email, this one's just a relay)
- *Fun fact:* I'm a Grapheme Synesthete which means that I see colors when I see graphemes (letters, numbers, characters, etc.) You can learn more about it on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphemeâ€“color_synesthesia)
- To all my fellow devs and gamers, have fun!

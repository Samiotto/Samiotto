## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- *I'm currently working on...* a planetary terrain generator! I'm exploring using volumetric noise/pixels, fibonacci spheres, and perlin noise.
- *Iâ€™m currently learning...* about Game Development at JCCC. I'm exploring topics in procedural generation, npc ai/behavior, and the workings of the unity engine.
- *Fun fact:* I'm a Grapheme Synesthete which means that I see colors when I see graphemes (letters, numbers, characters, etc.) You can learn more about it on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphemeâ€“color_synesthesia)
- To all my fellow devs and gamers, have fun!
